# Expo Camera API Intermittency

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API alongside other React Native components. The issue results in unreliable camera preview rendering and inconsistent image/video capture. 

## Bug Description:

The camera preview may fail to render properly, or images/videos may not capture correctly or at all. This behavior is often intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently.  The suspected cause is a conflict or timing issue between the Expo Camera and another component or library.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the camera preview; you may find it rendering inconsistently or capture failing.

## Solution:

The provided solution (`bugSolution.js`) addresses the issue by carefully managing the camera's lifecycle and ensuring that rendering and state updates don't interfere with the camera preview. Note that the fix might need adaptations based on the specific components and libraries involved in your project.
